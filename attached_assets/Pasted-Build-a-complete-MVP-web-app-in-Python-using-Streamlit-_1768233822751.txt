Build a complete MVP web app in Python using Streamlit called "PoliSee Clarity".

What the app does (high-level description to show users):
PoliSee Clarity is a consumer-first tool that helps homeowners understand their existing homeowners insurance policy before a disaster happens. 
Users upload their current policy PDF → choose a "what if" scenario (like burst pipe, hail on roof, basement flood, hurricane, fire, tree falling on house, etc.) → the app uses OpenAI to analyze the actual policy document and instantly shows:
- What is covered vs. what is excluded
- Estimated out-of-pocket costs (after deductible, depreciation, etc.)
- Gap alerts (e.g., "Flood/seepage not covered – consider adding endorsement")
- Plain-language summary and recommendations
The goal is transparency and preparation: "Understand. Prepare. Protect." before a claim is ever filed. It empowers users to avoid nasty surprises like denied claims or huge uncovered losses.

Technical requirements for the MVP:
- Mobile-first responsive design (works well on phones and desktop)
- Clean navy-blue theme with good typography for small screens
- Use Streamlit components: title, description, file_uploader (PDF only), selectbox for scenarios, expanders, metrics, dataframes/tables, warnings/errors for UX
- Welcome screen: big title "PoliSee Clarity: Understand. Prepare. Protect.", short pitch paragraph, upload area
- Scenarios dropdown: Burst Pipe / Interior Water Leak, Roof Hail Damage, Basement Flood (Groundwater Seepage), Fence Wind Damage, Tree Damage to Dwelling, Appliance Power Surge, Hurricane, Fire, Theft
- When PDF is uploaded:
  - Use openai Python client to upload the file to OpenAI Files API with purpose='user_data'
  - Get the file_id
  - Show success message and file_id in debug expander
- When scenario is selected and file exists:
  - Call OpenAI Chat Completions (model='gpt-4o-mini' or 'gpt-4o') 
  - Pass the file_id directly in the content array as a document reference
  - Use a strong system prompt that tells the model:
    - You are an expert homeowners insurance policy analyzer for PoliSee Clarity
    - Analyze ONLY the uploaded policy PDF for the given scenario
    - Be conservative, reference typical policy language (sudden/accidental discharge, surface water exclusion, wear & tear, etc.)
    - Output ONLY valid JSON with these exact keys:
      - covered_items: array of objects [{item: str, est_replacement_cost: number, depreciation_pct: number, acv_payout: number}]
      - not_covered_items: array of strings or objects
      - deductible: number
      - total_out_of_pocket: number or null
      - gap_alerts: array of strings (e.g. "Flood not covered", "Mold from long-term seepage excluded")
      - recommendations: array of strings
      - plain_summary: short plain-language explanation (2-4 sentences)
  - Parse the JSON response
  - Display results beautifully:
    - st.metric for "Estimated Out-of-Pocket" and "Policy Health Score" (100 - (len(gaps) * 20), min 0)
    - st.dataframe for covered/not-covered breakdown (nice columns)
    - st.warning / st.error / st.success for gap alerts and coverage status
    - Expander for full summary and recommendations
- Backend storage: Use Replit's native PostgreSQL database
  - Table: policy_analysis_results
  - Columns: id (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY), upload_timestamp (TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()), scenario (TEXT), file_id (TEXT), openai_response_json (TEXT), out_of_pocket_estimate (NUMERIC), gap_alerts (TEXT), user_session_id (TEXT optional)
  - After each successful analysis, INSERT the key data
- Add a "View Backend Data" expander/button at bottom that runs SELECT * FROM policy_analysis_results ORDER BY upload_timestamp DESC LIMIT 10; and shows in st.dataframe
- Handle OpenAI API key securely via st.secrets["OPENAI_API_KEY"] (instruct user to add it in Replit Secrets)
- Error handling: friendly messages for no file, invalid key, API errors, bad JSON, PDF too large
- Install required packages: streamlit, openai, psycopg2-binary
- Add basic session state to remember file_id across reruns in the same session
- Mobile optimizations: use expanders heavily, scrollable tables, touch-friendly buttons, custom CSS for padding/font on small screens
- Footer: "Understand. Prepare. Protect." + small text "PoliSee Clarity – Insurance made clear"

Generate the full main.py file with all imports, connection functions, and the complete Streamlit app structure. Make it ready to run after adding the OpenAI key in secrets.
